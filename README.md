Omnifocus-modernize-theme
=========================

I like the look of Omnifocus 2 but it's not ready for everyday use so I decided to make a theme for OF1 with the renewed look.

It's a theme that comes with a small script to copy some icons into the resources of Omnifocus 1

It looks like this:

## How to install 

In a terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/deadsunrise/Omnifocus-modernize-theme.git 
    cd Omnifocus-modernize-theme
    sh ./install.sh

Apply the theme and restart omnifocus. It should look better now.
  


### To go back to the unmodified version

    mv /Applications/Omnifocus-backup.app /Applications/Omnifocus.app



### Disclaimer

It assumes that omnifocus is installed in /Applications/Omnifocus.app

Icons taken from OF2 beta.  I hope that omnigroup doesn't mind because they can also be found in public screenshots.
