Omnifocus-modernize-theme
=========================

I like the look of OmniFocus 2 but it's not ready for everyday use so I decided to make a theme for OF1 with the renewed look.

It's a theme that comes with a small script to copy some icons into the resources of OmniFocus 1.

It looks like this:

## Installation

At the command line (Terminal or iTerm), type:

    git clone https://github.com/deadsunrise/Omnifocus-modernize-theme.git 
    cd Omnifocus-modernize-theme
    sh ./install.sh

When prompted, click "Replace" to apply the them, and restart OmniFocus.
  
### To go back to the original version

    cd Omnifocus-modernize-theme
    sh ./uninstall.sh

### Disclaimer

By default, the script assumes that OmniFocus is installed in `/Applications/OmniFocus.app`. This can be configured in line 3 of `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh`.

Icons taken from OF2 beta. I hope that OmniGroup doesn't mind because they can also be found in public screenshots.
