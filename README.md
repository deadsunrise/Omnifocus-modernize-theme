Omnifocus-modernize-theme
=========================

I like the look of Omnifocus 2 but it's still not ready for everyday use so I decided to make Omnifocus 1 look a little bit more like  the new version.

Looks like this:

    git clone https://github.com/deadsunrise/Omnifocus-modernize-theme.git 
    cd Omnifocus-modernize-theme
    sh ./install.sh
    open omnifocus2.ofocus-theme


Don't forget to apply the theme and restart omnifocus.
