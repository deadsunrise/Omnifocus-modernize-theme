Omnifocus-modernize-theme
=========================

I like the look of Omnifocus 2 but it's still not ready for everyday use so I decided to make Omnifocus 1 look a little bit more like  the new version.

        git clone https://github.com/deadsunrise/Omnifocus-modernize-theme.git 
        cd Omnifocus-modernize-theme
        sh -x install.sh
        open omnifocus2.ofocus-theme


Also, apply the theme
